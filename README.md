# DCS Training Mission

A DCS Training Mission, originally modified from [xaoslaad](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/?CREATED_BY=xaoslaad&set_filter=Y)'s
"[Free Flight and Practice - Black Sea](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3301568/)".  Modifications include some additional aircraft
in other parts of the maps, changes to radio configurations, and other features identified through deployment on our public training server.
